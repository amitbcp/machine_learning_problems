    "# Inference and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a trained network, you can use it for making predictions. This is typically called **inference**, a term borrowed from statistics. However, neural networks have a tendency to perform *too well* on the training data and aren't able to generalize to data that hasn't been seen before. This is called **overfitting** and it impairs inference performance. To test for overfitting while training, we measure the performance on data not in the training set called the **validation** dataset. We avoid overfitting through regularization such as dropout while monitoring the validation performance during training. In this notebook, I'll show you how to do this in PyTorch. \n",

    "\n",
    "As with MNIST, each image in Fashion-MNIST is 28x28 which is a total of 784 pixels, and there are 10 classes. I'm going to get a bit more advanced here, I want to be able to build a network with an arbitrary number of hidden layers. That is, I want to pass in a parameter like `hidden_layers = [512, 256, 128]` and the network is contructed with three hidden layers have 512, 256, and 128 units respectively. To do this, I'll use `nn.ModuleList` to allow for an arbitrary number of hidden layers. Using `nn.ModuleList` works pretty much the same as a normal Python list, except that it registers each hidden layer `Linear` module properly so the model is aware of the layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue here is I need a way to define each `nn.Linear` module with the appropriate layer sizes. Since each `nn.Linear` operation needs an input size and an output size, I need something that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create ModuleList and add input layer\n",
    "hidden_layers = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_layers[0])])\n",
    "# Add hidden layers to the ModuleList\n",
    "hidden_layers.extend([nn.Linear(h1, h2) for h1, h2 in layer_sizes])\n",

    "hidden_layers = [512, 256, 128, 64]\n",
    "layer_sizes = zip(hidden_layers[:-1], hidden_layers[1:])\n",
    "for each in layer_sizes:\n",
    "    print(each)\n",

    ">> (256, 128)\n",
    ">> (128, 64)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I also have the `forward` method returning the log-softmax for the output. Since softmax is a probability distibution over the classes, the log-softmax is a log probability which comes with a [lot of benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_probability). Using the log probability, computations are often faster and more accurate. To get the class probabilities later, I'll need to take the exponential (`torch.exp`) of the output. Algebra refresher... the exponential function is the inverse of the log function:\n",
